# Web_site_ASP.NET
A small Starset fan-site created using ASP.NET MVC

Note: Not all files could be included (e.g. libraries and the database).

This is a small project made in ASP.NET MVC (Visual Studio).

I have implemented external login with FaceBook, and I made it require both the first name and e-mail. A hello message will appear with the current username (chosen 
on register or the first name requested from FB) in the top right corner. 
The image and video gallery pages let only the admin make changes. The admin can delete, update (replace the current image/video with another) or add images and videos. 
The gallery rearranges itself when changes are made. 
There is also a chat, but it's only public.

The admin can add an image from their computer, and it will automatically be saved in the "ImagesGallery" directory. The full path to the image is saved to the database.
Note: My screen capture recording doesn't show how I chose the file from my computer for some reason. 
The difference with the videos is that they are not being saved anywhere. The videos are embedded directly from youtube.
